            <div id="para1" class="firstquestion">
                <p>We focus on making meals with the best and freshest ingredients, like humanely-raised beef that is ground fresh each day, oragnic chicken, and Rockey Family Dairy's organic cream for our ice cream cones, sundaes and shakes.</p>
                <p>Our commitment to freshness and quality means higher prices than you'd find at a traditional fast-food burger chains. It also means food that tastes way better -- because, well, it is.</p>

            <h3><button onclick="click2()">Where does your beef come from?</button></h3>
            <div id="para2" class="secondquestion">
                <p>We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local, family-owned ranches. We use an 85% to 15% protein to fat blend, a mixture of the lean protein and the marbling found on in a cut of steak for our ground beef. The mixture is ground daily, and thus, our burgers taste so amazing.</p>
